% Molehills, not mountains! - SPJ
% ie. don't try and solve everything ambitiously,
% attack a very specific problem with specific examples

% 1st page
%
% 1. Intro
% - write *explicitly* "the main idea of this paper is"
%   - but only once you have set up enough scaffolding for context
% 2. Contributions
% - write early, and rewrite
%   - need to know what the contributions are early
% - list of contributions drive everything in the paper
% - consider bullet points
%   - make it *so* easy to read
%   - *don't* lose readers here
% - *every* claim has a forward reference to *evidence* that supports the claim
% - pg 1 = spec, rest of paper = impl
% - Contributions *must* be *refutable*
%    - NOT We describe/study the properties of this type system
%    - YES We prove the soundness of ...
%    - *crunchy!* refutable contributions
%      - "think celery, not soggy pasta claims!"
% 
% Give citations *during the paper* (or, we will discuss this related work in section ..)
% "You know all about the literature! You're just getting there at the end.. (of the paper)"

% - Related work
%   - don't make other people's work look bad!
%   - you have unlimited love to spread around
%   - praise inspiring papers!
%     - credit to the author
%     - it won't make your work looks worse
%   - "in this dimension, our work is better (worse!!)"
%     - point out your shortcomings before your reviews
%     - not just honest/scholarly, just good tactics

% Put your readers first
% - "the middle section"
%   - easier to write (the stuff in your head)
% - don't present the general solution first
%   - "Consider a semilattice B over hyperstructural interposed structure C ...."
%   - might be obvious to you (you've learnt this!) but not *motivating* for readers
%   - what would you do at the whiteboard?
%     - explain the intuition *first*
%     - even if the reader leaves the paper here, they still still take something away
% - Conveying the intuition
%   - examples! (at the whiteboard..)
%   - we can't help giving examples in conversation, but in papers we can't help giving the general case first!!

% Don't bring your readers down blind alleys
% - research is soaked in (your) blood
%   - don't bring your readers down the dead ends
% - *only* explore bind alleys that are *so* obvious the reader is itching to correct you as you explain your
%   solution!

\section*{Introduction}

% Start immediately with an example, like at a whiteboard

Here's how to make an inline code sample: \lstinline|lift-chan|.

This is how to cite~\cite{Tob10} something.
